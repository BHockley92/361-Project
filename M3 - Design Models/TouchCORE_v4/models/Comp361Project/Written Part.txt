All game move operations are controlled by the GameLogic class. 
We've chosen this class to be the controller because it aggregates the game state manipulation logic.

beginTurn is controlled by the GameLogic class. We've chosen the GameLogic class because it controls the 
state of a game instance and beginTurn is an abstraction of a rule of the game. 

newGame is controlled by the MedievalWarfare class. We've chosen this class because we may have 
multiple games running and so we need a class that overlooks game to keep track of multiple game instances.
