Where all of the information from our project will be stored.

![github workflow](http://nvie.com/img/2009/12/Screen-shot-2009-12-24-at-11.32.03.png)

To accompany this, we will be using semantic versioning with slight modifications. The outline of semantic versioning can be found [here](http://semver.org/). 

Since we are not using an API, it will be adjusted as follows for software.

1. Major releases (Overhauls of systems, Multiplayer, Etc) will move a version from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
2. Feature additions (New Skins For Characters, Etc) will move a version from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0
3. Bug fixes (Game no longer crashes when clicking enter) will move a version from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2

Note: When submitting, a description of the submission is **REQUIRED**
Include a breif description of all work done and more specifically, include whether you have made a bug fix, a feature addition, or an overhaul/addition of a system.

If you would like further clarification, please email [me](mailto://bhockley92@gmail.com).
