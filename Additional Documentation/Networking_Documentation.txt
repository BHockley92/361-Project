MWNetwork:

1.	Regarding turns:
	1.1	Tells you whether it is your turn.  GUI should be designed in such a way as to disable certain options when it is not your turn.
	1.2	Provides a function for ending your turn, which also notifies the next player that it is his turn.
	
2.	Regarding rooms:
	2.1	Provides a list of available rooms.
	2.2	Provides a function for joining a room.
	2.3	Notifies other players when a player left the room.  Provides an appropriate error code (from an enum).

3.	Regarding game state:
	3.1	Provides a function for updating other players' game state.  In this model, a player will not see another player's movement until it is "serviced"
		(at each call by this API's user).

4.	Regarding credentials:
	4.1	Verifies the provided user name and password credentials, returning an appropriate message.
	4.2	Adds users to a database using the provided credentials. (no removing necessary at this point)
	
5.	Regarding statistics:
	5.1	Provides a/many function(s) for updating a player's statistics.
	5.2	Could potentially be done automatically... TBD.
		
6.	Regarding the network's status:
	6.1	Implements all necessary callbacks given various connectivity issues with the network and other players.

7.	Regarding the game's state:
	7.1	Saves a room's game state if all players are disconnected.
		This means there is no need to save the game explicitly. Ever. (TBC)
